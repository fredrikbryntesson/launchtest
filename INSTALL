Note: make install does two things
  1) Copy the manpage to /usr/local/man/man1 (override with MAN_INSTALL_PATH)
  2) Create a symbolic link from bin/rock to /usr/bin/rock
     (override with PREFIX=/usr/local or BIN_INSTALL_PATH=~/bin)

You have a -source release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'make && sudo make install'

You have a binary release (e.g. rock-X.X.X-linux32, rock-X.X.X-win32, etc.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'sudo make install'

Troubleshooting
---------------

Help! rock doesn't find its sdk!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's how rock tries to find it:

1) If the ROCK_SDK environment variable is set, take that path
2) If the ROCK_DIST environment variable is set, take $ROCK_DIST/custom-sdk
3) If none of the above are set, tries to locate itself and tries ../custom-sdk
   (works if you've symlinked the rock executable to /usr/bin or something.)

Help! rock doesn't find its libraries!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The only lib rock depends on is the Boehm GC (if you don't turn it off
via -gc=off)

We have static binary builds of the Boehm GC for most platforms/archs,
look in rock/libs/

If we don't have your platform/arch, try to install the Boehm GC yourself,
and compile with -gc=dynamic (it'll link with -lgc instead of the static
binary builds)

Don't be afraid to open Makefile and build/Makefile
